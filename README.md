---
##**Overview and Origin**  
**Company Name:**  
Albert Investments

Albert Investments is an SEC registered investment advisory firm effective 12/3/2018  
**Founders:**  
Albert Corp which owns Albert Investments was founded by Yinon Ravid and Andrzej Baraniak Yinon Ravid is the CEO of Albert Investments  
**How did the idea for the company come about?:**  
After many a family get-together in which he was asked finance questions,  
Yinon founded Albert on the idea of having a smart friend you could ask any money question.  
In the first few years of the company's existance Albert relied on Betterment for investment advice. However, with the launch  
of Albert Investments now the company maintains the relationship with their customer versus referring the customer to Betterment.  
**How is the company been funded? How much funding have they received?**  
On January 26, 2021 the company closed a Series C round in which $100M was raised. This brings the company's total  
funding to $172.9M. Prior to the Series C, Albert had Series A and Series B rounds as well as three Seed rounds  
and one Pre Seed round. This indicates that a most if not all of the company's funding has been from investors.  
###**Business Activities:**  
**What specific problem is the company trying to solve?**  
Historicially over the long term savings accounts have not outperformed inflation. This means that a savings account will not  
help one build wealth. As a matter of fact, leaving money in a savings account over the long term will actually reduce one's  
purchasing power. For the majority of us the only true way to grow our wealth is to invest in the stock and bond markets.  
However, investing in the markets can be quite scary. This is where Albert Investments portfolio by Genius offers a solution.  
Portfolio by Genius is Albert Investmetns version of a robo-advisor in with the customer answers a few questions about their  
goals, risk tolerance and time horizon and then receive a recommended portfolio of ETFs. Albert Investments also has an offering  
for those customers who a self-managed account. However, this is not your typical self-managed account where you pick your own  
stocks or ETFs. The Albert Investments self-managed account allows the customer to pick holdings from a curated list of themes.  
Whether the customer chooses portfolio by Genius or a self-managed account the problem that Albert Investments solves is how to  
help Americans grow their wealth.
